Programming Paradigms

A programming paradigm is a style or way of writing code.
It defines how we think, structure, and solve problems in programming.

This repo gives a short description of the main paradigms.

1. Imperative Programming

You tell the computer how to do things step by step.
Example: using loops, variables, and assignments.
🧩 Example: C, Python, JavaScript

2. Procedural Programming

A type of imperative programming that organizes code into functions or procedures.
It helps make code reusable and easy to understand.
🧩 Example: C, Pascal

3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Code is built around objects — things that have data (attributes) and actions (methods).
It helps organize large programs and makes them modular.
🧩 Example: Java, C++, Python

4. Functional Programming

Focuses on pure functions and immutability (no changing data).
You describe what to do instead of how to do it.
🧩 Example: Haskell, Lisp, Elixir, Python

5. Declarative Programming

You describe the result you want, not the process.
The computer decides how to achieve it.
🧩 Example: SQL, HTML

6. Logic Programming

Based on facts and rules.
The computer uses logic to find answers.
🧩 Example: Prolog

🎯 Goal of This Repo

To explain the basic programming paradigms with simple descriptions and examples.
It helps beginners understand how different coding styles work.
